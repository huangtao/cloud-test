[Help us](https://github.com/openstf/adbkit/issues/48)!**_\n\n**adbkit** is a pure [Node.js][nodejs] client for the [Android Debug Bridge][adb-site] server. It can be used either as a library in your own application, or simply as a convenient utility for playing with your device.\n\nMost of the `adb` command line tool's functionality is supported (including pushing/pulling files, installing APKs and processing logs), with some added functionality such as being able to generate touch/key events and take screenshots. Some shims are provided for older devices, but we have not and will not test anything below Android 2.3.\n\nInternally, we use this library to drive a multitude of Android devices from a variety of manufacturers, so we can say with a fairly high degree of confidence that it will most likely work with your device(s), too.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* [Node.js][nodejs] >= 0.10\n* The `adb` command line tool\n\nPlease note that although it may happen at some point, **this project is NOT an implementation of the ADB _server_**. The target host (where the devices are connected) must still have ADB installed and either already running (e.g. via `adb start-server`) or available in `$PATH`. An attempt will be made to start the server locally via the aforementioned command if the initial connection fails. This is the only case where we fall back to the `adb` binary.\n\nWhen targeting a remote host, starting the server is entirely your responsibility.\n\nAlternatively, you may want to consider using the Chrome [ADB][chrome-adb] extension, as it includes the ADB server and can be started/stopped quite easily.\n\n## Getting started\n\nInstall via NPM:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save adbkit\n```\n\nWe use [debug][node-debug], and our debug namespace is `adb`. Some of the dependencies may provide debug output of their own. To see the debug output, set the `DEBUG` environment variable. For example, run your program with `DEBUG=adb:* node app.js`.\n\nNote that even though the module is written in [CoffeeScript][coffeescript], only the compiled JavaScript is published to [NPM][npm], which means that it can easily be used with pure JavaScript codebases, too.\n\n### Examples\n\nThe examples may be a bit verbose, but that's because we're trying to keep them as close to real-life code as possible, with flow control and error handling taken care of.\n\n#### Checking for NFC support\n\n```js\nvar Promise = require('bluebird')\nvar adb = require('adbkit')\nvar client = adb.createClient()\n\nclient.listDevices()\n  .then(function(devices) {\n    return Promise.filter(devices, function(device) {\n      return client.getFeatures(device.id)\n        .then(function(features) {\n          return features['android.hardware.nfc']\n        })\n    })\n  })\n  .then(function(supportedDevices) {\n    console.log('The following devices support NFC:', supportedDevices)\n  })\n  .catch(function(err) {\n    console.error('Something went wrong:', err.stack)\n  })\n```\n\n#### Installing an APK\n\n```js\nvar Promise = require('bluebird')\nvar adb = require('adbkit')\nvar client = adb.createClient()\nvar apk = 'vendor/app.apk'\n\nclient.listDevices()\n  .then(function(devices) {\n    return Promise.map(devices, function(device) {\n      return client.install(device.id, apk)\n    })\n  })\n  .then(function() {\n    console.log('Installed %s on all connected devices', apk)\n  })\n  .catch(function(err) {\n    console.error('Something went wrong:', err.stack)\n  })\n```\n\n#### Tracking devices\n\n```js\nvar adb = require('adbkit')\nvar client = adb.createClient()\n\nclient.trackDevices()\n  .then(function(tracker) {\n    tracker.on('add', function(device) {\n      console.log('Device %s was plugged in', device.id)\n    })\n    tracker.on('remove', function(device) {\n      console.log('Device %s was unplugged', device.id)\n    })\n    tracker.on('end', function() {\n      console.log('Tracking stopped')\n    })\n  })\n  .catch(function(err) {\n    console.error('Something went wrong:', err.stack)\n  })\n```\n\n#### Pulling a file from all connected devices\n\n```js\nvar Promise = require('bluebird')\nvar fs = require('fs')\nvar adb = require('adbkit')\nvar client = adb.createClient()\n\nclient.listDevices()\n  .then(function(devices) {\n    return Promise.map(devices, function(device) {\n      return client.pull(device.id, '/system/build.prop')\n        .then(function(transfer) {\n          return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n            var fn = '/tmp/' + device.id + '.build.prop'\n            transfer.on('progress', function(stats) {\n              console.log('[%s] Pulled %d bytes so far',\n                device.id,\n                stats.bytesTransferred)\n            })\n            transfer.on('end', function() {\n              console.log('[%s] Pull complete', device.id)\n              resolve(device.id)\n            })\n            transfer.on('error', reject)\n            transfer.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(fn))\n          })\n        })\n    })\n  })\n  .then(function() {\n    console.log('Done pulling /system/build.prop from all connected devices')\n  })\n  .catch(function(err) {\n    console.error('Something went wrong:', err.stack)\n  })\n```\n\n#### Pushing a file to all connected devices\n\n```js\nvar Promise = require('bluebird')\nvar adb = require('adbkit')\nvar client = adb.createClient()\n\nclient.listDevices()\n  .then(function(devices) {\n    return Promise.map(devices, function(device) {\n      return client.push(device.id, 'temp/foo.txt', '/data/local/tmp/foo.txt')\n        .then(function(transfer) {\n          return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n            transfer.on('progress', function(stats) {\n              console.log('[%s] Pushed %d bytes so far',\n                device.id,\n                stats.bytesTransferred)\n            })\n            transfer.on('end', function() {\n              console.log('[%s] Push complete', device.id)\n              resolve()\n            })\n            transfer.on('error', reject)\n          })\n        })\n    })\n  })\n  .then(function() {\n    console.log('Done pushing foo.txt to all connected devices')\n  })\n  .catch(function(err) {\n    console.error('Something went wrong:', err.stack)\n  })\n```\n\n#### List files in a folder\n\n```js\nvar Promise = require('bluebird')\nvar adb = require('adbkit')\nvar client = adb.createClient()\n\nclient.listDevices()\n  .then(function(devices) {\n    return Promise.map(devices, function(device) {\n      return client.readdir(device.id, '/sdcard')\n        .then(function(files) {\n          // Synchronous, so we don't have to care about returning at the\n          // right time\n          files.forEach(function(file) {\n            if (file.isFile()) {\n              console.log('[%s] Found file \"%s\"', device.id, file.name)\n            }\n          })\n        })\n    })\n  })\n  .then(function() {\n    console.log('Done checking /sdcard files on connected devices')\n  })\n  .catch(function(err) {\n    console.error('Something went wrong:', err.stack)\n  })\n```\n\n## API\n\n### ADB\n\n#### adb.createClient([options])\n\nCreates a client instance with the provided options. Note that this will not automatically establish a connection, it will only be done when necessary.\n\n* **options** An object compatible with [Net.connect][net-connect]'s options:\n    - **port** The port where the ADB server is listening. Defaults to `5037`.\n    - **host** The host of the ADB server. Defaults to `'localhost'`.\n    - **bin** As the sole exception, this option provides the path to the `adb` binary, used for starting the server locally if initial connection fails. Defaults to `'adb'`.\n* Returns: The client instance.\n\n#### adb.util.parsePublicKey(androidKey[, callback])\n\nParses an Android-formatted mincrypt public key (e.g. `~/.android/adbkey.pub`).\n\n* **androidKey** The key String or [`Buffer`][node-buffer] to parse. Not a filename.\n* **callback(err, output)** Optional. Use this or the returned `Promise`.\n    - **err** `null` when successful, `Error` otherwise.\n    - **key** The key as a [forge.pki](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge#rsa) public key. You may need [node-forge](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge) for complicated operations. Additionally the following properties are present:\n      * **fingerprint** The key fingerprint, like it would display on a device. Note that this is different than the one you'd get from `forge.ssh.getPublicKeyFingerprint(key)`, because the device fingerprint is based on the original format.\n      * **comment** The key comment, if any.\n* Returns: `Promise`\n* Resolves with: `key` (see callback)\n\n#### adb.util.readAll(stream[, callback])\n\nTakes a [`Stream`][node-stream] and reads everything it outputs until the stream ends. Then it resolves with the collected output. Convenient with `client.shell()`.\n\n* **stream** The [`Stream`][node-stream] to read.\n* **callback(err, output)** Optional. Use this or the returned `Promise`.\n    - **err** `null` when successful, `Error` otherwise.\n    - **output** All the output as a [`Buffer`][node-buffer]. Use `output.toString('utf-8')` to get a readable string from it.\n* Returns: `Promise`\n* Resolves with: `output` (see callback)\n\n### Client\n\n#### client.clear(serial, pkg[, callback])\n\nDeletes all data associated with a package from the device. This is roughly analogous to `adb shell pm clear <pkg>`.\n\n* **serial** The serial number of the device. Corresponds to the device ID in `client.listDevices()`.\n* **pkg** The package name. This is NOT the APK.\n* **callback(err)** Optional. Use this or the returned `Promise`.\n    - **err** `null` when successful, `Error` otherwise.\n* Returns: `Promise`\n* Resolves with: `true`\n\n#### client.connect(host[, port]&#91;, callback])\n\nConnects to the given device, which must have its ADB daemon running in tcp mode (see `client.tcpip()`) and be accessible on the same network. Same as `adb connect <host>:<port>`.\n\n* **host** The target host. Can also contain the port, in which case the port argument is not used and can be skipped.\n* **port** Optional. The target port. Defaults to `5555`.\n* **callback(err, id)** Optional. Use this or the returned `Promise`.\n    - **err** `null` when successful, `Error` otherwise.\n    - **id** The connected device ID. Can be used as `serial` in other commands.\n* Returns: `Promise`\n* Resolves with: `id` (see callback)\n\n##### Example - switch to TCP mode and set up a forward for Chrome devtools\n\nNote: be careful with using `client.listDevices()` together with `client.tcpip()` and other similar methods that modify the connection with ADB. You might have the same device twice in your device list (i.e. one device connected via both USB and TCP), which can cause havoc if run simultaneously.\n\n```javascript\nvar Promise = require('bluebird')\nvar client = require('adbkit').createClient()\n\nclient.listDevices()\n  .then(function(devices) {\n    return Promise.map(devices, function(device) {\n      return client.tcpip(device.id)\n        .then(function(port) {\n          // Switching to TCP mode causes ADB to lose the device for a\n          // moment, so let's just wait till we get it back.\n          return client.waitForDevice(device.id).return(port)\n        })\n        .then(function(port) {\n          return client.getDHCPIpAddress(device.id)\n            .then(function(ip) {\n              return client.connect(ip, port)\n            })\n            .then(function(id) {\n              // It can take a moment for the connection to happen.\n              return client.waitForDevice(id)\n            })\n            .then(function(id) {\n              return client.forward(id, 'tcp:9222', 'localabstract:chrome_devtools_remote')\n                .then(function() {\n                  console.log('Setup devtools on \"%s\"', id)\n                })\n            })\n        })\n    })\n  })\n```\n\n#### client.disconnect(host[, port]&#91;, callback])\n\nDisconnects from the given device, which should have been connected via `client.connect()` or just `adb connect <host>:<port>`.\n\n* **host** The target host. Can also contain the port, in which case the port argument is not used and can be skipped. In other words you can just put the `id` you got from `client.connect()` here and it will be fine.\n* **port** Optional. The target port. Defaults to `5555`.\n* **callback(err, id)** Optional. Use this or the returned `Promise`.\n    - **err** `null` when successful, `Error` otherwise.\n    - **id** The disconnected device ID. Will no longer be usable as a `serial` in other commands until you've connected again.\n* Returns: `Promise`\n* Resolves with: `id` (see callback)\n\n#### client.forward(serial, local, remote[, callback])\n\nForwards socket connections from the ADB server host (local) to the device (remote). This is analogous to `adb forward <local> <remote>`. It's important to note that if you are connected to a remote ADB server, the forward will be created on that host.\n\n* **serial** The serial number of the device. Corresponds to the device ID in `client.listDevices()`.\n* **local** A string representing the local endpoint on the ADB host. At time of writing, can be one of:\n    - `tcp:<port>`\n    - `localabstract:<unix domain socket name>`\n    - `localreserved:<unix domain socket name>`\n    - `localfilesystem:<unix domain socket name>`\n    - `dev:<character device name>`\n* **remote** A string representing the remote endpoint on the device. At time of writing, can be one of:\n    - Any value accepted by the `local` argument\n    - `jdwp:<process pid>`\n* **callback(err)** Optional. Use this or the returned `Promise`.\n    - **err** `null` when successful, `Error` otherwise.\n* Returns: `Promise`\n* Resolves with: `true`\n\n#### client.framebuffer(serial[, format]&#91;, callback])\n\nFetches the current **raw** framebuffer (i.e. what is visible on the screen) from the device, and optionally converts it into something more usable by using [GraphicsMagick][graphicsmagick]'s `gm` command, which must be available in `$PATH` if conversion is desired. Note that we don't bother supporting really old framebuffer formats such as RGB_565. If for some mysterious reason you happen to run into a `>=2.3` device that uses RGB_565, let us know.\n\nNote that high-resolution devices can have quite massive framebuffers. For example, a device with a resolution of 1920x1080 and 32 bit colors would have a roughly 8MB (`1920*1080*4` byte) RGBA framebuffer. Empirical tests point to about 5MB/s bandwidth limit for the ADB USB connection, which means that it can take ~1.6 seconds for the raw data to arrive, or even more if the USB connection is already congested. Using a conversion will further slow down completion.\n\n* **serial** The serial number of the device. Corresponds to the device ID in `client.listDevices()`.\n* **format** The desired output format. Any output format supported by [GraphicsMagick][graphicsmagick] (such as `'png'`) is supported. Defaults to `'raw'` for raw framebuffer data.\n* **callback(err, framebuffer)** Optional. Use this or the returned `Promise`.\n    - **err** `null` when successful, `Error` otherwise.\n    - **framebuffer** The possibly converted framebuffer stream. The stream also has a `meta` property with the following values:\n        * **version** The framebuffer version. Useful for patching possible backwards-compatibility issues.\n        * **bpp** Bits per pixel (i.e. color depth).\n        * **size** The raw byte size of the framebuffer.\n        * **width** The horizontal resolution of the framebuffer. This SHOULD always be the same as screen width. We have not encountered any device with incorrect framebuffer metadata, but according to rumors there might be some.\n        * **height** The vertical resolution of the framebuffer. This SHOULD always be the same as screen height.\n        * **red_offset** The bit offset of the red color in a pixel.\n        * **red_length** The bit length of the red color in a pixel.\n        * **blue_offset** The bit offset of the blue color in a pixel.\n        * **blue_length** The bit length of the blue color in a pixel.\n        * **green_offset** The bit offset of the green color in a pixel.\n        * **green_length** The bit length of the green color in a pixel.\n        * **alpha_offset** The bit offset of alpha in a pixel.\n        * **alpha_length** The bit length of alpha in a pixel. `0` when not available.\n        * **format** The framebuffer format for convenience. This can be one of `'bgr'`,  `'bgra'`, `'rgb'`, `'rgba'`.\n* Returns: `Promise`\n* Resolves with: `framebuffer` (see callback)\n\n#### client.getDevicePath(serial[, callback])\n\nGets the device path of the device identified by the given serial number.\n\n* **serial** The serial number of the device. Corresponds to the device ID in `client.listDevices()`.\n* **callback(err, path)** Optional. Use this or the returned `Promise`.\n    - **err** `null` when successful, `Error` otherwise.\n    - **path** The device path. This corresponds to the device path in `client.listDevicesWithPaths()`.\n* Returns: `Promise`\n* Resolves with: `path` (see callback)\n\n#### client.getDHCPIpAddress(serial[, iface]&#91;, callback])\n\nAttemps to retrieve the IP address of the device. Roughly analogous to `adb shell getprop dhcp.<iface>.ipaddress`.\n\n* **serial** The serial number of the device. Corresponds to the device ID in `client.listDevices()`.\n* **iface** Optional. The network interface. Defaults to `'wlan0'`.\n* **callback(err, ip)** Optional. Use this or the returned `Promise`.\n    - **err** `null` when successful, `Error` otherwise.\n    - **ip** The IP address as a `String`.\n* Returns: `Promise`\n* Resolves with: `ip` (see callback)\n\n#### client.getFeatures(serial[, callback])\n\nRetrieves the features of the device identified by the given serial number. This is analogous to `adb shell pm list features`. Useful for checking whether hardware features such as NFC are available (you'd check for `'android.hardware.nfc'`).\n\n* **serial** The serial number of the device. Corresponds to the device ID in `client.listDevices()`.\n* **callback(err, features)** Optional. Use this or the returned `Promise`.\n    - **err** `null` when successful, `Error` otherwise.\n    - **features** An object of device features. Each key corresponds to a device feature, with the value being either `true` for a boolean feature, or the feature value as a string (e.g. `'0x20000'` for `reqGlEsVersion`).\n* Returns: `Promise`\n* Resolves with: `features` (see callback)\n\n#### client.getPackages(serial[, callback])\n\nRetrieves the list of packages present on the device. This is analogous to `adb shell pm list packages`. If you just want to see if something's installed, consider using `client.isInstalled()` instead.\n\n* **serial** The serial number of the device. Corresponds to the device ID in `client.listDevices()`.\n* **callback(err, packages)** Optional. Use this or the returned `Promise`.\n    - **err** `null` when successful, `Error` otherwise.\n    - **packages** An array of package names.\n* Returns: `Promise`\n* Resolves with: `packages` (see callback)\n\n#### client.getProperties(serial[, callback])\n\nRetrieves the properties of the device identified by the given serial number. This is analogous to `adb shell getprop`.\n\n* **serial** The serial number of the device. Corresponds to the device ID in `client.listDevices()`.\n* **callback(err, properties)** Optional. Use this or the returned `Promise`.\n    - **err** `null` when successful, `Error` otherwise.\n    - **properties** An object of device properties. Each key corresponds to a device property. Convenient for accessing things like `'ro.product.model'`.\n* Returns: `Promise`\n* Resolves with: `properties` (see callback)\n\n#### client.getSerialNo(serial[, callback])\n\nGets the serial number of the device identified by the given serial number. With our API this doesn't really make much sense, but it has been implemented for completeness. _FYI: in the raw ADB protocol you can specify a device in other ways, too._\n\n* **serial** The serial number of the device. Corresponds to the device ID in `client.listDevices()`.\n* **callback(err, serial)** Optional. Use this or the returned `Promise`.\n    - **err** `null` when successful, `Error` otherwise.\n    - **serial** The serial number of the device.\n* Returns: `Promise`\n* Resolves with: `serial` (see callback)\n\n#### client.getState(serial[, callback])\n\nGets the state of the device identified by the given serial number.\n\n* **serial** The serial number of the device.

It may have a `.code` property containing the error code reported by the device.\n* Returns: `Promise`\n* Resolves with: `true`\n\n##### Example - install an APK from a URL\n\nThis example requires the [request](https://www.npmjs.org/package/request) module. It also doesn't do any error handling (404 responses, timeouts, invalid URLs etc).\n\n```javascript\nvar client = require('adbkit').createClient()\nvar request = require('request')\nvar Readable = require('stream').Readable\n\n// The request module implements old-style streams, so we have to wrap it.\nclient.install('<serial>', new Readable().wrap(request('http://example.org/app.apk')))\n  .then(function() {\n    console.log('Installed')\n  })\n```\n\n#### client.installRemote(serial, apk[, callback])\n\nInstalls an APK file which must already be located on the device file system, and replaces any previously installed version. Useful if you've previously pushed the file to the device for some reason (perhaps to have direct access to `client.push()`'s transfer stats). This is roughly analogous to `adb shell pm install -r <apk>` followed by `adb shell rm -f <apk>`.\n\nNote that if the call seems to stall, you may have to accept a dialog on the phone first.\n\n* **serial** The serial number of the device.

A single sync service instance is used to download the `/proc/stat` file for processing. While doing this does consume some resources, it is very light and should not be a problem.\n\n* **serial** The serial number of the device. Corresponds to the device ID in `client.listDevices()`.\n* **callback(err, stats)** Optional. Use this or the returned `Promise`.\n    - **err** `null` when successful, `Error` otherwise.\n    - **stats** The `/proc/stat` tracker, which is an [`EventEmitter`][node-events]. Call `stat.end()` to stop tracking. The following events are available:\n        * **load** **(loads)** Emitted when a CPU load calculation is available.\n            - **loads** CPU loads of **online** CPUs.

It's important to note that if you are connected to a remote ADB server, the reverse will be created on that host.\n\n* **serial** The serial number of the device. Corresponds to the device ID in `client.listDevices()`.\n* **remote** A string representing the remote endpoint on the device. At time of writing, can be one of:\n    - `tcp:<port>`\n    - `localabstract:<unix domain socket name>`\n    - `localreserved:<unix domain socket name>`\n    - `localfilesystem:<unix domain socket name>`\n* **local** A string representing the local endpoint on the ADB host.

This is analogous to `adb shell screencap -p`. Sadly, the utility is not available on most Android `<=2.3` devices, but a silent fallback to the `client.framebuffer()` command in PNG mode is attempted, so you should have its dependencies installed just in case.\n\nGenerating the PNG on the device naturally requires considerably more processing time on that side. However, as the data transferred over USB easily decreases by ~95%, and no conversion being required on the host, this method is usually several times faster than using the framebuffer. Naturally, this benefit does not apply if we're forced to fall back to the framebuffer.\n\nFor convenience purposes, if the screencap command fails (e.g. because it doesn't exist on older Androids), we fall back to `client.framebuffer(serial, 'png')`, which is slower and has additional installation requirements.\n\n* **serial** The serial number of the device. Corresponds to the device ID in `client.listDevices()`.\n* **callback(err, screencap)** Optional. Use this or the returned `Promise`.\n    - **err** `null` when successful, `Error` otherwise.\n    - **screencap** The PNG stream.\n* Returns: `Promise`\n* Resolves with: `screencap` (see callback)\n\n#### client.shell(serial, command[, callback])\n\nRuns a shell command on the device.

Corresponds to the device ID in `client.listDevices()`.\n* **command** The shell command to execute. When `String`, the command is run as-is. When `Array`, the elements will be rudimentarily escaped (for convenience, not security) and joined to form a command.\n* **callback(err, output)** Optional. Use this or the returned `Promise`.\n    - **err** `null` when successful, `Error` otherwise.\n    - **output** A Buffer containing all the output. Call `output.toString('utf-8')` to get a readable String from it.\n* Returns: `Promise`\n* Resolves with: `output` (see callback)\n\n##### Example\n\n```js\nvar Promise = require('bluebird')\nvar adb = require('adbkit')\nvar client = adb.createClient()\n\nclient.listDevices()\n  .then(function(devices) {\n    return Promise.map(devices, function(device) {\n      return client.shell(device.id, 'echo $RANDOM')\n        // Use the readAll() utility to read all the content without\n        // having to deal with the events. `output` will be a Buffer\n        // containing all the output.\n        .then(adb.util.readAll)\n        .then(function(output) {\n          console.log('[%s] %s', device.id, output.toString().trim())\n        })\n    })\n  })\n  .then(function() {\n    console.log('Done.')\n  })\n  .catch(function(err) {\n    console.error('Something went wrong:', err.stack)\n  })\n```\n\n#### client.startActivity(serial, options[, callback])\n\nStarts the configured activity on the device.

Simple values like `null`, `String`, `Boolean` and `Number` are type-mapped automatically (`Number` maps to `'int'`) and can be used as-is. For more complex types, like arrays and URIs, set the value to be an `Object` like in the Array syntax (see above), but leave out the `key` property.\n* **callback(err)** Optional. Use this or the returned `Promise`.\n    - **err** `null` when successful, `Error` otherwise.\n* Returns: `Promise`\n* Resolves with: `true`\n\n#### client.startService(serial, options[, callback])\n\nStarts the configured service on the device.

See `client.listDevices()` for details on the device object.\n        * **change** **(device)** Emitted when the `type` property of a device changes, once per device. The current value of `type` is the new value. This event usually occurs the type changes from `'device'` to `'offline'` or the other way around. See `client.listDevices()` for details on the device object and the `'offline'` type.\n        * **changeSet** **(changes)** Emitted once for all changes reported by ADB in a single run. Multiple changes can occur when, for example, a USB hub is connected/unplugged and the device list changes quickly.

See below for details.\n\n#### sync.push(contents, path[, mode])\n\nAttempts to identify `contents` and calls the appropriate `push*` method for it.\n\n* **contents** When `String`, treated as a local file path and forwarded to `sync.pushFile()`. Otherwise, treated as a [`Stream`][node-stream] and forwarded to `sync.pushStream()`.\n* **path** The path to push to.\n* **mode** Optional. The mode of the file. Defaults to `0644`.\n* Returns: A `PushTransfer` instance. See below for details.\n\n#### sync.pushFile(file, path[, mode])\n\nPushes a local file to the given path. Note that the path must be writable by the ADB user (usually `shell`). When in doubt, use `'/data/local/tmp'` with an appropriate filename.\n\n* **file** The local file path.\n* **path** See `sync.push()` for details.\n* **mode** See `sync.push()` for details.\n* Returns: See `sync.push()` for details.\n\n#### sync.pushStream(stream, path[, mode])\n\nPushes a [`Stream`][node-stream] to the given path.

Can be useful for reading endless streams of data, such as `/dev/urandom` or `/dev/zero`, perhaps for benchmarking use. Note that you must create a new sync connection if you wish to continue using the sync service.\n\n* Returns: The pullTransfer instance.\n\n# Incompatible changes in version 2.x\n\nPreviously, we made extensive use of callbacks in almost every feature. While this normally works okay, ADB connections can be quite fickle, and it was starting to become difficult to handle every possible error. For example, we'd often fail to properly clean up after ourselves when a connection suddenly died in an unexpected place, causing memory and resource leaks.\n\nIn version 2, we've replaced nearly all callbacks with [Promises](http://promisesaplus.com/) (using [Bluebird](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird)), allowing for much more reliable error propagation and resource cleanup (thanks to `.finally()`). Additionally, many commands can now be cancelled on the fly, and although unimplemented at this point, we'll also be able to report progress on long-running commands without any changes to the API.\n\nUnfortunately, some API changes were required for this change. `client.framebuffer()`'s callback, for example, previously accepted more than one argument, which doesn't translate into Promises so well. Thankfully, it made sense to combine the arguments anyway, and we were able to do it quite cleanly.\n\nFurthermore, most API methods were returning the current instance for chaining purposes. While perhaps useful in some contexts, most of the time it probably didn't quite do what users expected, as chained calls were run in parallel rather than in serial fashion. Now every applicable API method returns a Promise, which is an incompatible but welcome change. This will also allow you to hook into `yield` and coroutines in Node 0.12.\n\n**However, all methods still accept (and will accept in the future) callbacks for those who prefer them.**\n\nTest coverage was also massively improved, although we've still got ways to go.\n\n## More information\n\n* [Android Debug Bridge][adb-site]\n    - [SERVICES.TXT][adb-services] (ADB socket protocol)\n* [Android ADB Protocols][adb-protocols] (a blog post explaining the protocol)\n* [adb.js][adb-js] (another Node.js ADB implementation)\n* [ADB Chrome extension][chrome-adb]\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## License\n\nSee [LICENSE](LICENSE).\n\nCopyright © The OpenSTF Project.
