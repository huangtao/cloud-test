If a module lazy loads another module at a later time that require call will not bypass the cache anymore.\n\nThis means you should have a close look at all internal require calls before you decide to use this library.\n\n## Installation\n\n[![NPM Stats](https://nodei.co/npm/stealthy-require.png?downloads=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/stealthy-require)\n\nThis is a module for node.js and is installed via npm:\n\n``` bash\nnpm install stealthy-require --save\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nLet's say you want to bypass the require cache for this require call:\n\n``` js\nvar request = require('request');\n```\n\nWith `stealthy-require` you can do that like this:\n\n``` js\nvar stealthyRequire = require('stealthy-require');\n\nvar requestFresh = stealthyRequire(require.cache, function () {\n    return require('request');\n});\n```\n\nThe require cache is bypassed for the module you require (i.e. `request`) as well as all modules the module requires (i.e. `http` and many more).\n\n## Usage with Module Bundlers\n\n- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io) works out-of-the-box like described in the [Usage section](#usage) above.\n- [Browserify](http://browserify.org) does not expose `require.cache`. However, as of `browserify@13.0.1` the cache is passed as the 6th argument to CommonJS modules. Thus you can pass this argument instead:\n\n``` js\n// Tweak for Browserify - using arguments[5] instead of require.cache\nvar requestFresh = stealthyRequire(arguments[5], function () {\n    return require('request');\n});\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo set up your development environment for `stealthy-require`:\n\n1. Clone this repo to your desktop,\n2. in the shell `cd` to the main folder,\n3. hit `npm install`,\n4. hit `npm install gulp -g` if you haven't installed gulp globally yet, and\n5. run `gulp dev`. (Or run `node ./node_modules/.bin/gulp dev` if you don't want to install gulp globally.)\n\n`gulp dev` watches all source files and if you save some changes it will lint the code and execute all tests. The test coverage report can be viewed from `./coverage/lcov-report/index.html`.\n\nIf you want to debug a test you should use `gulp test-without-coverage` to run all tests without obscuring the code by the test coverage instrumentation.\n\n## Change History\n\n- v1.0.0 (2016-07-18)\n    - **Breaking Change:** API completely changed. Please read the [Usage section](#usage) again.\n    - Redesigned library to support module bundlers like [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io) and [Browserify](http://browserify.org)\n- v0.1.0 (2016-05-26)\n    - Initial version\n\n## License (ISC)\n\nIn case you never heard about the [ISC license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license) it is functionally equivalent to the MIT license.\n\nSee the [LICENSE file](LICENSE) for details.\n",
